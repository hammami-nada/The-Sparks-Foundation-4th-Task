-The Global Terrorism Database (GTD), available at https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/, is an accessible resource containing comprehensive data on terrorist activities worldwide spanning from 1970 to 2017. Covering both domestic and international incidents, the GTD catalogues over 180,000 attacks. It is curated by scholars affiliated with the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), based at the University of Maryland.

-The database boasts a wealth of features that make it an invaluable resource for understanding terrorist activities worldwide. With information on over 180,000 attacks, it stands as the most comprehensive unclassified database of its kind globally. Spanning from 1970 to recent years, it covers a staggering array of incidents, including over 88,000 bombings, 19,000 assassinations, and 11,000 kidnappings. Each case is richly detailed, encompassing at least 45 variables, with more recent entries expanding to over 120 variables. What's more, the meticulous curation process involved scrutinizing over 4,000,000 news articles and 25,000 news sources, underscoring the depth and breadth of its coverage, especially from 1998 to 2017.
